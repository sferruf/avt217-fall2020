    <p>Oliver and Bosco Ferrufino</p>
    <p>Ever since Bosco Ferrufino was a little boy, he enjoyed being in the kitchen, learning traditional Italian recipes and being around family.  He later became a renowned food critic, tasting delicious food from local restaurants in Washington D.C.. Bosco loves eating!</p>
    <p>In May of 2019, Bosco met Oliver Ferrufino, a French boy who wanted to make Italian food with Bosco. At first they had a hard time getting along but they became great friends and do everything together. Bosco then got the brilliant idea of opening his own restaurant with Oliver.</p>
